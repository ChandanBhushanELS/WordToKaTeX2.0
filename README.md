# Word To KaTeX 2.0
![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)

The Evelyn Learning has ETBS project in which the MathType equations has to be converted to their corresponding KaTeX codes to proceed further. To do so, Word To KaTeX 2.0 software has been developed which does exactly the same.
Writing manual KaTeX code may take a lot of the valuable time and is not easy implement for a huge number of files.
Word To KaTeX 2.0 does exactly the same with ease and save the time and effort of the responsible. This takes a bunch of documents as input and produce documents with all the MathType equations converted to KaTeX codes at their corresponding locations in the document file.
This project extends the functionality of the content creation process at Evelyn.

## [KaTeX](https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX)
KaTeX is a fast, easy-to-use JavaScript library for TeX math rendering on the web.

 * **Fast:** KaTeX renders its math synchronously and doesn't need to reflow the page. See how it compares to a competitor in [this speed test](http://www.intmath.com/cg5/katex-mathjax-comparison.php).
 * **Print quality:** KaTeX's layout is based on Donald Knuth's TeX, the gold standard for math typesetting.
 * **Self contained:** KaTeX has no dependencies and can easily be bundled with your website resources.
 * **Server side rendering:** KaTeX produces the same output regardless of browser or environment, so you can pre-render expressions using Node.js and send them as plain HTML.

KaTeX is compatible with all major browsers, including Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Opera, Edge, and IE 11.

KaTeX supports much (but not all) of LaTeX and many LaTeX packages. See the [list of supported functions](https://katex.org/docs/supported.html).

## [MathType SDK](https://docs.wiris.com/en/mathtype/mathtype_desktop/mathtype-sdk)
The MathType SDK is primarily for developers who want to explore the advanced capabilities of MathType. The SDK also includes documentation about equation formats and other related information. The MathType SDK is available to developers who:

* want to customize the special commands that MathType installs into Microsoft Word
* want documentation for MathType's DLL interface
* want to modify MathType's translators or create their own translators
* want to extend MathType's knowledge of fonts and characters
* want to make their product "equation-friendly" by aligning imported equations with the baseline of surrounding text

The MathType SDK is available for both Windows and Mac and has been updated to the latest releases, 6.9 for Windows, 6.7 for Mac. There are no changes for MathType 7.x.

### MathType SDK Introduction

The MathType API consists of a WLL, two Microsoft Word document templates containing VBA macros, and a separate DLL (on Windows only).

On Windows, the DLL is named MT6.DLL and is located in the System folder inside the MathType folder. This DLL manages all communications with MathType itself, launching MathType when necessary. Most of the functions in the DLL provide support for the MathType commands added to Word. All API functions in MT6.DLL begin with the prefix MT.

The WLL (basically a DLL with some Word-specific entry points) is named MathPage.WLL. On Windows, it is installed in the Office Startup folder. For the MathType 6 Word Commands on Windows, all entry points to the DLL are accessed via the WLL. This is partly due to the way VBA code calls functions in a DLL, and partly because a single entry-point makes for a cleaner architecture. We recommend that you follow this model. The WLL contains the MathPage functions (prefixed by MP), which help in converting a Word document to HTML. This is a fairly complicated process and you're unlikely to use any of the individual MathPage functions. The WLL also contains other functions used by the MathType Commands for Word; these functions begin with the MT prefix.

There are two Word templates located in the Office Support folder inside the MathType folder: the stub, named MathType 6 Commands for Word.dot; and the commands, named WordCmds.dot. The stub template is also copied to the Microsoft Word Startup location during installation, and gets loaded when Word starts. The first time a MathType command is used in Word, the commands template is explicitly loaded from the Office Support folder inside the MathType folder. These two templates are used in this manner in order to avoid long Word startup times. The stub template has been kept as small as possible so that a minimal delay will occur when Word starts. The commands template takes a few seconds to load; users only pay this price the first time they use any MathType command. The stub contains handlers for each toolbar button and menu command; each of them loads the commands template if it isn't loaded yet, and then calls a function in the commands template that actually does the work. If you want to call your own function in the WordCmds.dot template, be sure to use the same kind of handler as the existing commands. The handler functions not only verify the correct versions of the WLLs and load the WordCmds.dot template, they also call some initialization routines that are necessary for the API functions to work.

The best way to understand how a particular command works is to follow through the VBA code. The SDK contains unlocked copies of these templates so that you can see the code. It contains comments which should make it easier to understand. The file MT6SDK.dot (in the SDK's templates folder) contains some additional functions that may be useful if you want to suppress the dialogs that normally appear during Format, Convert, Export and Toggle Equations. See the MathType Commands For Word API for details.

Two sample templates are provided: SDKTest.dot and MTVarSub.dot. The first template,SDKTest.dot, contains examples of how to call Format, Convert, Export and Toggle Equations non-interactively, as well as a simple search-and-replace example. MTVarSub.dot shows the many variations possible for search-and-replace, a.k.a variable substitution.  To avoid problems with macro security in Word 2000 and above on Windows, set your security level to Medium or Low, since these macros are unsigned.You must create a reference to MT6SDK.dot before running any of the test macros in these two templates. To do this, switch to the Visual Basic Editor via ALT-F11 on Windows and select Tools|References, then select MT6SDK.dot from the list. If it is not in the list, use the Browse button to locate it in the templates folder inside the SDK folder.

### Office locations
The MathType installer places the stub template into the Word Startup folder which, on Windows, varies depending on the version of Office installed. This is a per-machine location as opposed to a per-user location, and Word will use this folder no matter which user is logged on. On Windows, the WLL is also copied to this location. On a Mac, it's a per-user location, and like Windows, varies depending on the version of Office installed.

### MathTypeEquation.cs
MathTypeEquation.cs is a program file containing all the methods to create objects of MathType equations embedded in Word documents. It contains methods to convert the OLEObjects embedded in Word document to LaTeX, AMSTeX,MathML, MTEF, etc. It also contains the methods to create the MathTypeEquation object and to dispose the created object.

To activate a MathType OLE Object, the following is used within MathTypeEquation
```sh
 public MathTypeEquation(OLEFormat oleFormat)
{
    // Activate MathType and update the equation object according to the current MathType version.
    oleFormat.DoVerb(2); 
    oleObject  = oleFormat.Object as IOleObject;
    dataObject = oleObject as IDataObject;
}
```
Get/Set default LaTeX from/to MathType:

```sh
public string LaTeX
{
    get {
        return Encoding.ASCII.GetString(GetData(FormatTeXInputLanguage, TYMED.TYMED_HGLOBAL));
            }
    set {
        SetData(Encoding.Unicode.GetBytes(value), FormatTeXInputLanguage, TYMED.TYMED_HGLOBAL);
    }
}
```
Get/Set default MathML from/to MathType:
```sh
public string MathML
{
    get
    {
        return Encoding.ASCII.GetString(GetData(FormatMathMl, TYMED.TYMED_HGLOBAL));
    }
    set 
    { 
        SetData(Encoding.Unicode.GetBytes(value), FormatMathMl, TYMED.TYMED_HGLOBAL); 
    }
}
```

To Dispose the MathTyepEquation Object:
```sh
public void Dispose()
{
    oleObject.Close((uint)OLECLOSE.OLECLOSE_SAVEIFDIRTY);
}
```

### WordToKaTeX.cs
WordToKaTeX.cs is the driver program which consists of the following two main modules:
* `ExtractMathTypes()`
* `RefineSolutions()`

`ExtractMahTypes()`:
This module extracts all the embedded MathType objects (OLEObjects) form the Word documents in `LaTeX` format. Later, the `LaTeX` is converted to the `KaTeX` format by doing certain changes in the generated `LaTeX` codes. Post the `KaTeX` Conversion, the MathType objects are replaced with their corresponding codes.

To open MS Word file use the following:
```sh 
Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word.Application app = new Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word.Application();
Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word.Document doc = app.Documents.Open(FileName, ReadOnly: false);
```
Here, FineName is the `FileName` is the path to the file which is supposed to be opened to proceed further. We can iterate over the files using any loop.

This modules uses the following lists in order to store the `LaTeX` code, `KaTeX` codes and `MathType` objects respectively.
```sh
List<string> mathMLList = new List<string>();
List<string> KatexList = new List<string>();
List<MSWord.Range> ranges = new List<Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word.Range>();
```
To iterate through the oleobjects within a Word file, use the following:
```sh
foreach (MSWord.Section sec in doc.Sections)
{
	foreach (MSWord.Paragraph para in sec.Range.Paragraphs)
	{
		foreach (InlineShape ishape in para.Range.InlineShapes)
		{
			if (ishape.OLEFormat.ProgID.StartsWith("Equation."))
			{
				MathTypeEquation mobj = new MathTypeEquation(ishape.OLEFormat);
				mathMLList.Add(mobj.LaTeX);
				mobj.Dispose();
				ranges.Add(ishape.Range);
				ishape.Delete();
			}
		}
	}
}
```
Here,
* `ishape.OLEFormat.ProgID.StartsWith("Equation.")` checks if the oleobject(`ishape`) is a MathType object.
* `MathTypeEquation mobj = new MathTypeEquation(ishape.OLEFormat)` creates the MathTypeEquation object which need to be converted to `LaTeX`.
* `mobj.LaTeX` converts the MathType object to its corresponding `LaTeX` code. We can use `mobj.MathML` to convert MathType objects to their corresponding `MathML` and `mobj.AMSTeX` to `AMSTeX`.
* `mobj.Dispose()` closes the OLEObject.
* `ranges.Add(ishape.Range)` is adding the current MathType object `ishape` to the `ranges` list for replacing the MathType to their corresponding `KaTeX` code.
* `ishape.Delete()` deletes the object form the Word file.

The following section of the code converts the generated `LaTeX` into `KaTeX` code by doing the certain replacements. All the generated `LaTeX` codes are kept in the `MathMLList` and after the conversion, all the `KaTeX` codes are kept in `KaTeXList`.

```sh
foreach (string item in mathMLList)
{
	string citem = item.ToString().Replace(Environment.NewLine, "").Replace(@"\[", @"\(").Replace(@"\]", @"\)").Replace(@"\begin{align}", @"\begin{aligned}").Replace(@"\end{align}", @"\end{aligned}").Replace("{}", "").Replace("&", "").Replace("=", "&=").Replace("{&=}", "{=}");
	Regex regex = new Regex(@"text{(\s)*");
	foreach (Match ItemMatch in regex.Matches(citem))
	{
		string filler = String.Concat(Enumerable.Repeat(@"\,", (ItemMatch.Value.Length - 5)));
		textBox1.AppendText(citem + " <> " + ItemMatch.Value + "-" + "text{" + filler + Environment.NewLine);
		if (citem.Contains(ItemMatch.Value))
		{
			textBox1.AppendText("True" + Environment.NewLine);
		}
		var regex1 = new Regex(Regex.Escape(ItemMatch.Value));
		citem = regex1.Replace(citem, "text{" + filler, 1);
	}

	if (citem.Contains(@"\begin{matrix}"))
	{
		citem = citem.Replace(@"\begin{matrix}", @"\begin{array}{cccccccc}").Replace(@"\end{matrix}", @"\end{array}").Replace("   ", "").Replace("  ", "&&").Replace(@"&\\", @"\\\\").Replace("frac", "cfrac").Replace(@"&\\\\", @"\\\\").Replace(@"\\\\\end", @"\\\end").Replace("cdots", "cdots&&").Replace("vdots", "vdots&&").Replace("ddots", "ddots&&");
		er.WriteLine("WARNING! - " + Path.GetFileName(file).ToString() + ": Check if the matrix at index " + (mathMLList.IndexOf(item) + 1).ToString() + " in the solution file contains any verticle line or horizontal line in it. Please use the matrix guidelines for KaTeX to resolve the issue");
	}

	if (citem.ToString().Contains("aligned"))
	{
		//do nothing
	}
	else
	{
		citem = citem.Replace("&=", "=").Replace(@"&\ne", @"\ne");
	}

	citem = citem.Replace(@"{\rm E}", @"\Epsilon").Replace(@"\varepsilon", @"\epsilon").Replace(@"\ne", @"\ne ").Replace(@"\ne g", @"\neg ").Replace(@"\le", @"\le ").Replace("le ft", "left").Replace(@"\approx", @"&\approx ").Replace(@"\partial", @"\partial ").Replace("cdot", "cdot ").Replace("cdot s", "cdots").Replace(@"\Delta", @"\Delta ").Replace(@"\delta", @"\delta ").Replace(@"%", @"\%").Replace(@"\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \", " ");

	string tempStr = citem.Replace(@"\(", "").Replace(@"\)", "");
	Regex reg = new Regex(@"\(([^)]+)\)*");
	foreach (Match ItemMatch in reg.Matches(tempStr))
	{
		string temp = ItemMatch.Value.Replace("&=", "=");
		citem = citem.Replace(ItemMatch.Value, temp);
	}
	Regex reg1 = new Regex(@"\{([^)]+)\}}*");
	foreach (Match ItemMatch in reg.Matches(tempStr))
	{
		string temp = ItemMatch.Value.Replace("&=", "=");
		citem = citem.Replace(ItemMatch.Value, temp);
	}

	if (citem.Substring(0, 1) == "$")
	{
		citem = citem.Trim('$');
		citem = @"\(" + citem + @"\)";
	}

	citem = citem.Replace(@"\cdot", @"\cdot ").Replace(@"\cdot s", @"\cdots").Replace(@"&&\\", @"\\").Replace(@"\ne g", @"\neg ");

	if (isChemistry.Checked)
	{
		citem = citem.Replace(@"\Xi", @"\overrightharpoon{\,_\leftharpoondown}");
	}

	KatexList.Add(citem);
}
```
To replace the MathType Objects with their corresponding KaTeX codes, use the following:
```sh
int mcount = 0;
foreach (MSWord.Range r in ranges)
{
	r.Text = KatexList[mcount].ToString();
	mcount++;
}
```
### RefineSolutions.cs
This module checks if the MathType Objects are inline or block. If the MathType equations are block, it replaces the starting and ending of the KaTeX codes as `\[` and `\]` respectively and if inline, the starting and ending of KaTeX codes remains same as `\(` and `\)` respectively.

The following section of the code replaces the concern form the Word document:
```sh
MSWord.Application app = new MSWord.Application();
MSWord.Document doc = app.Documents.Open(file, ReadOnly: false);

foreach (MSWord.Section sec in doc.Sections)
{
	foreach (MSWord.Paragraph para in sec.Range.Paragraphs)
	{
		string currLine = para.Range.Text.ToString();
		if(currLine.StartsWith(@"\("))
		{
			currLine = currLine.Replace(@"\(", @"\[").Replace(@"\)", @"\]");
			para.Range.Text = currLine;
		}
	}
}
```

This software also includes zipping of directories and files in one go.
To make ZIP of directories in a directory, use the following piece of code:

```sh
string[] subdirectoryEntries = Directory.GetDirectories("path to the root directory");
foreach (string subdirectory in subdirectoryEntries)
{
    string startPath = subdirectory;
    string zipPath = subdirectory + ".zip";
    ZipFile.CreateFromDirectory(startPath, zipPath);
}
```
You need to include the `System.IO.Compression` in references of your project within the VisualStudio.
